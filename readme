# Live.js for WordPress

This extremely simple plugin adds the [Live.js](http://livejs.com/) script by [Martin Kool](http://twitter.com/mrtnkl) to your theme automatically when you are logged in and running it locally.

Your CSS and JavaScript files will automatically refresh each time you save them, so you don't need to reload the page.

HTML refreshing has been specifically disabled, because the constant blinking of the page while it is remade will not help you focus while you code!
